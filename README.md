:::note
Certain differences may exist based on the permissions you have in your text editor and command prompt. Using the packaged "node" user and their corresponging UID and GID seems to work for most systems. However, if you run into permissions issues, consider the implications of the user id and group id that you are using when you create files in the GUI.
